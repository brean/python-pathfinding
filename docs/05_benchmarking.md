# Benchmarking
Many pathfinding algorithms need more system resources the bigger the input grid is, some are optimized for specific scenarios to (for example Jump-Point Search) for narrow passages, while others like Dijkstra are for a general solution that come at the cost of looking at all cells of the grid in the worst case.
